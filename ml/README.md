# TensorFlow Compression

TensorFlow Compression (TFC) contains data compression tools for TensorFlow.

You can use this library to build your own ML models with end-to-end optimized
data compression built in. It's useful to find storage-efficient representations
of your data (images, features, examples, etc.) while only sacrificing a tiny
fraction of model performance. It can compress any floating point tensor to a
much smaller sequence of bits.

Specifically, the entropy model classes in this library simplify the process of
designing rate–distortion optimized codes. During training, they act like
likelihood models. Once training is completed, they encode floating point
tensors into optimal bit sequences by automating the design of probability
tables and calling a range coder implementation behind the scenes.

The main novelty of this method over traditional transform coding is the
stochastic minimization of the rate-distortion Lagrangian, and using nonlinear
transforms implemented by neural networks. For an introduction to this, consider
our [paper on nonlinear transform coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03034), or
watch @jonycgn's [talk on learned image
compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_q7cZviXkY).

feature requests. On Discussions, you may get a faster answer, and you help
other people find the question or answer more easily later.

Refer to [the API
documentation](https://tensorflow.github.io/compression/docs/api_docs/python/tfc.html)
for a complete description of the classes and functions this package implements.

## Installation

***Note: Precompiled packages are currently only provided for Linux and
Darwin/Mac OS and Python 3.6-3.8. To use these packages on Windows, consider
using a [TensorFlow Docker image](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker) and
installing TensorFlow Compression using pip inside the Docker container.***

Set up an environment in which you can install precompiled binary Python
packages using the `pip` command. Refer to the
[TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
for more information on how to set up such a Python environment.

The current version of TensorFlow Compression requires TensorFlow 2. For
versions compatible with TensorFlow 1, see our [previous
releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/compression/releases).
***Note: Because TFC currently relies on features and fixes designated for
TF 2.5, the pip package currently depends on tf-nightly packages. Once TF 2.5 is
released (likely in April 2021), we will resume depending on the stable version
of TF.***

### pip

To install TFC via `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
pip uninstall -y tensorflow
pip install tf-nightly==2.5.0.dev20210312 tensorflow-compression
```

To test that the installation works correctly, you can run the unit tests with:

```bash
python -m tensorflow_compression.all_tests
```

Once the command finishes, you should see a message ```OK (skipped=29)``` or
similar in the last line.

### Docker

To use a Docker container (e.g. on Windows), be sure to install Docker
(e.g., [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)),
use a [TensorFlow Docker image](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker),
and then run the `pip install` command inside the Docker container, not on the
host. For instance, you can use a command line like this:

```bash
docker run tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly bash -c \
    "pip install tf-nightly==2.5.0.dev20210312 tensorflow-compression &&
     python -m tensorflow_compression.all_tests"
```

This will fetch the TensorFlow Docker image if it's not already cached, install
the pip package and then run the unit tests to confirm that it works.

### Anaconda

It seems that [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) ships its own
binary version of TensorFlow which is incompatible with our pip package. To
solve this, always install TensorFlow via `pip` rather than `conda`. For
example, this creates an Anaconda environment with Python 3.8 and CUDA
libraries, and then installs TensorFlow and TensorFlow Compression:

```bash
conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.8 cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn
conda activate ENV_NAME
pip install tf-nightly==2.5.0.dev20210312 tensorflow-compression
```

## Usage

We recommend importing the library from your Python code as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_compression as tfc
```

### Using a pre-trained model to compress an image

In the
[models directory](https://github.com/tensorflow/compression/tree/master/models),
you'll find a python script `tfci.py`. Download the file and run:

```bash
python tfci.py -h
```

This will give you a list of options. Briefly, the command

```bash
python tfci.py compress <model> <PNG file>
```

will compress an image using a pre-trained model and write a file ending in
`.tfci`. Execute `python tfci.py models` to give you a list of supported
pre-trained models. The command

```bash
python tfci.py decompress <TFCI file>
```

will decompress a TFCI file and write a PNG file. By default, an output file
will be named like the input file, only with the appropriate file extension
appended (any existing extensions will not be removed).

### Training your own model

The
[models directory](https://github.com/tensorflow/compression/tree/master/models)
contains several implementations of published image compression models to enable
easy experimentation. The instructions below talk about a re-implementation of
the model published in:

> "End-to-end optimized image compression"<br />
> J. Ballé, V. Laparra, E. P. Simoncelli<br />
> https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01704

Note that the models directory is not contained in the pip package. The models
are meant to be downloaded individually. Download the file `bls2017.py` and run:

```bash
python bls2017.py -h
```

This will list the available command line options for the implementation.
Training can be as simple as the following command:

```bash
python bls2017.py -V train
```

This will use the default settings. Note that unless a custom training dataset
is provided via `--train_glob`, the
[CLIC dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/clic) will be
downloaded using TensorFlow Datasets.

The most important training parameter is `--lambda`, which controls the
trade-off between bitrate and distortion that the model will be optimized for.
The number of channels per layer is important, too: models tuned for higher
bitrates (or, equivalently, lower distortion) tend to require transforms with a
greater approximation capacity (i.e. more channels), so to optimize performance,
you want to make sure that the number of channels is large enough (or larger).
This is described in more detail in:

> "Efficient nonlinear transforms for lossy image compression"<br />
> J. Ballé<br />
> https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00847

If you wish, you can monitor progress with Tensorboard. To do this, create a
Tensorboard instance in the background before starting the training, then point
your web browser to [port 6006 on your machine](http://localhost:6006):

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/train_bls2017 &
```

When training has finished, the Python script saves the trained model to the
directory specified with `--model_path` (by default, `bls2017` in the current
directory) in TensorFlow's `SavedModel` format. The script can then be used to
compress and decompress images as follows. The same saved model must be
accessible to both commands.

```bash
python bls2017.py [options] compress original.png compressed.tfci
python bls2017.py [options] decompress compressed.tfci reconstruction.png
```

## Building pip packages

This section describes the necessary steps to build your own pip packages of
TensorFlow Compression. This may be necessary to install it on platforms for
which we don't provide precompiled binaries (currently only Linux and Darwin).

We use the custom-op Docker images (e.g.
`tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-custom-op-ubuntu16`) for building pip packages
for Linux. Note that this is different from `tensorflow/tensorflow:devel`. To be
compatible with the TensorFlow pip package, the GCC version must match, but
`tensorflow/tensorflow:devel` has a different GCC version installed. For more
information, refer to the [custom-op
instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op).

Inside a Docker container from the image, the following steps need to be taken.

1. Clone the `tensorflow/compression` repo from GitHub.
2. Run `:build_pip_pkg` inside the cloned repo.

For example:

```bash
sudo docker run -v /tmp/tensorflow_compression:/tmp/tensorflow_compression \
    tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-custom-op-ubuntu16 bash -c \
    "git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/compression.git
         /tensorflow_compression &&
     cd /tensorflow_compression &&
     bazel run -c opt --copt=-mavx :build_pip_pkg"
```

The wheel file is created inside `/tmp/tensorflow_compression`. Optimization
flags can be passed via `--copt` to the `bazel run` command above.

To test the created package, first install the resulting wheel file:

```bash
pip install /tmp/tensorflow_compression/tensorflow_compression-*.whl
```

Then run the unit tests (Do not run the tests in the workspace directory where
the `WORKSPACE` file lives. In that case, the Python interpreter would attempt
to import `tensorflow_compression` packages from the source tree, rather than
from the installed package system directory):

```bash
pushd /tmp
python -m tensorflow_compression.all_tests
popd
```

When done, you can uninstall the pip package again:

```bash
pip uninstall tensorflow-compression
```

To build packages for Darwin (and potentially other platforms), you can follow
the same steps, but the Docker image should not be necessary.

## Evaluation

We provide evaluation results for several image compression methods in terms of
different metrics in different colorspaces. Please see the
